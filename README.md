# React Query App

This is a simple Application that I built with React Javascript using  Vite.

Tools used:

- Axios
- React Query
- SWC (Super Web Compiler)
- Vite

This project has helped me to practice the usage of React Query to handle Server state globally in my application. The simple web app built here works with the [JSONPLACEHOLDER api](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)'s GET and POST endpoints for users and I demonstrated good usage of the React Query Library here.
